      <blockquote class="president-quote">
        I am very proud and happy to share my opinions about Padmashri
        Manibhai Desai College, a prestigious institution founded under the
        direction of Mahatma Gandhi Sarvodaya Sangh.
        Established in honour of Padmashri Manibhai Desai,
        this college has never wavered in its commitment to upholding the
        principles of independence, truth and service.
      </blockquote>

      <p class="president-body">
        A key component of social change has always been education.  
        In keeping with Gandhi's philosophy, we have worked to provide rural youth
        with high-quality higher education so they can develop into morally upright,
        socially conscious and professionally competent adults.
        The college’s dedication is evident through its consistent
        progress in research, academics and community engagement.
      </p>

      <p class="president-body">
        I sincerely appreciate the principal, teachers and staff for their commitment
        to shaping young minds and guiding them toward responsible citizenship.
        Their devotion ensures that Padmashri Manibhai Desai’s vision—  
        to combine knowledge with morality and service—continues to inspire
        future generations.
      </p>

      <p class="president-body">
        I encourage all students to dream big, work hard and carry forward the
        Gandhian tradition of rural development and thoughtful progress.
        Let us continue working together to build a future rooted in equality,
        peace and advancement for all.
      </p>
