        I am extremely proud to deliver my message to Padmashri Manibhai Desai
        College, an organisation that upholds the honourable traditions of
        Padmashri Manibhai Desai and Mahatma Gandhi.
      </blockquote>

      <p class="president-body">
        The college’s mission to spread education that enlightens minds and uplifts
        communities continues as a part of the Mahatma Gandhi Sarvodaya Sangh.
        Since its founding, the institution has remained committed to the principles
        of truth, simplicity and service to humanity.
      </p>

      <p class="president-body">
        Situated in Pune's rural heartland, it has provided countless students
        the opportunity to pursue higher education while staying connected to their
        heritage and core values.
      </p>

      <p class="president-body">
        The Sangh takes great pride in seeing how the college has stayed true to
        Gandhian ideals of social harmony and self-reliance, while simultaneously
        embracing modern teaching techniques, digital learning and strong
        community involvement. This balance between tradition and innovation is
        what makes the college truly exceptional.
      </p>

      <p class="president-body">
        I wholeheartedly appreciate the principal, teachers and staff for their
        unwavering dedication in maintaining the standards of excellence envisioned
        by Padmashri Manibhai Desai. I extend my best wishes to every student in
        their pursuit of knowledge and their future role as ambassadors of peace,
        humanity and progress.
