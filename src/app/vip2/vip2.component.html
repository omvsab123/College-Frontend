      <blockquote class="president-quote">
        I am very happy to say a few words about Padmashri Manibhai Desai College,
        an institution that upholds the principles and vision of Padmashri Manibhai Desai
        and Mahatma Gandhi.
        This college was founded to expand higher education in rural areas, but it has since grown
        into a hub for knowledge, morals and social change.
      </blockquote>

      <p class="president-body">
        The college, under the direction of the Mahatma Gandhi Sarvodaya Sangh, has dedicated its life to
        educating the rural youth and equipping them to live honourable, responsible and independent lives.
        In fostering young minds through holistic education, the principal, faculty and staff exemplify the
        spirit of Sarvodaya — the welfare of all.
      </p>

      <p class="president-body">
        Education must continue to promote moral fortitude, compassion and service to humanity in today’s
        fast-changing world. The fact that Padmashri Manibhai Desai College has upheld these principles
        while welcoming innovation and modern teaching techniques makes me proud.
      </p>

      <p class="president-body">
        I want to congratulate and extend my best wishes to the entire college community for their hard
        work in advancing the Gandhian philosophy and Manibhaiji's mission through education and
        community service.
      </p>
