        I am delighted to welcome you to Padmashri Manibhai Desai College,

        Our college stands in the historic village of Uruli Kanchan, a place blessed
        by the visit of Mahatma Gandhi and known for its enduring commitment to
        self-reliance, simplicity and social transformation.
      </p>

      <p class="president-body">
        Our founder, Padmashri Manibhai Desai, was a visionary leader and a true
        disciple of Mahatma Gandhi. His life’s mission was to bring education,
        progress and dignity to rural India. Inspired by his ideals, our college strives
        to blend academic excellence with moral and social responsibility, nurturing
        students who are intellectually capable and socially conscious.
      </p>

      <p class="president-body">
        In tune with the guiding principles of the NEP 2020, our college is dedicated
        to providing a holistic, multidisciplinary and inclusive education that empowers
        learners to become innovators, critical thinkers and responsible citizens.
        Through experiential learning, creativity and skill development we prepare
        students for the opportunities and challenges of the 21st century.
      </p>

      <p class="president-body">
        At Padmashri Manibhai Desai College, we believe that education is not merely
        a path to personal success but a means to serve society. Upholding the legacy
        of our founder, we continue to promote the values of hard work, compassion
        and rural upliftment through education.
      </p>

      <p class="president-body">
        I warmly invite students, parents and the community to join us in our
        collective mission — to enlighten minds, empower lives and build a better
        tomorrow grounded in the timeless values of truth, service and humanity.
