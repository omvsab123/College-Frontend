        I am delighted to send my warmest regards to all students, teachers and well-wishers of Padmashri Manibhai Desai College.
        As a living testament to the principles of service, simplicity and rural upliftment this college was established in the revered memory of Padmashri Manibhai Desai — a loyal disciple of Mahatma Gandhi.
